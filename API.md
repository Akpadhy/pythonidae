# C-CPP 
**wrappers for C and C++.**
* [XDress](https://github.com/xdress/xdress) :: is a Cython-based, NumPy-aware automatic wrapper generator for C/C++ written in pure Python. Currently, [xdress](http://xdress.org/) may generate Python bindings (via Cython) for C++ classes & functions and in-memory wrappers for C++ standard library containers (sets, vectors, maps).
