# BIOINFORMATICS
* [epitopes](https://github.com/hammerlab/epitopes) → Python interface to immunology and bioinformatics datasets (i.e. IEDB, cancer antigens, TCGA mutant peptides).
* biostar-central → [The software that runs the Biostars Bioinformatics Q&A at: http://www.biostars.org](https://github.com/ialbert/biostar-central)
* screed (GED@MSU.EDU) → [A simple read-only sequence database, designed for short reads](https://github.com/ged-lab/screed) from the Genomics, Evolution, and Development Lab. [Documentation](http://readthedocs.org/docs/screed/en/latest/)



# GENETICS
* CompleteGenomicsTools → [Complete Genomics provides whole-genome sequencing using DNA nanoball arrayed sequencing ](https://github.com/seandavi/CompleteGenomicsTools). Software for manipulating and visualizing Complete Genomics data, with a focus on cancer: http://watson.nci.nih.gov/~sdavis/software/cgent/
* [Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python (EA)](http://code.google.com/p/deap/)
* Genetic Programming → [Evolution of Mona Lisa](http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/). Here is the [non-Python LGPL licensed source code](http://code.google.com/p/alsing/downloads/list), which should make an interesting project to port to Python. 
   * [Pierre Lindenbaum's implementation of the Genetic Algorithm described by Roger Alsing](http://plindenbaum.blogspot.in/2008/12/random-notes-2008-12.html) above.
* [pygenetorrent](https://github.com/hammer/pygenetorrent) → A Python client for GeneTorrent.
