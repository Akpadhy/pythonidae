# GRAPHICS 
- [bitarray](https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray) :: This module provides an object type which efficiently represents an array of booleans.
- [EigenFace](https://github.com/bugra/EigenFace) :: EigenFace implementation in Python for Yale FaceDatabase. Eigenvectors are used in the computer vision problem of human face recognition.
- [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) :: Python Imaging Library, now forked as [pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/) to support Python3.

### Games
- [PySoy](http://www.pysoy.org/) is a 3d cloud game engine for  Python. [Source code](http://hg.pysoy.org/pysoy)

# INFOGRAPHICS
- [Arfview](https://github.com/kylerbrown/arfview) :: A data visualization program for use with data in the arf format.* [Biggles](https://github.com/nolta/biggles) : Scientific Plotting with/in/for Python.
- [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) :: is a Python library for visualizing large and realtime datasets on the web. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of Protovis/D3, while delivering high-performance interactivity to thin clients. Bokeh includes its own Javascript library (BokehJS) that implements a reactive scenegraph representation of the plot, and renders efficiently to HTML5 Canvas. Bokeh works well with IPython Notebook, but can generate standalone graphics that embed into regular HTML. If you are a Matplotlib user, you can just use %bokeh magic to start interacting with your plots in the notebook immediately!

- [brewer2mpl](https://github.com/jiffyclub/brewer2mpl) :: Connect colorbrewer2.org color maps to Python and matplotlib. [Wiki](https://github.com/jiffyclub/brewer2mpl/wiki)
- [d3py](https://github.com/mikedewar/d3py) :: is a plotting library for Python based on the JavaScript library "[D3.js](http://d3js.org/)".
- [Glue](https://github.com/glue-viz/glue) :: is a python project to link visualizations of scientific datasets across many files.
- GmtPy :: [A Python interface to GMT](http://emolch.github.com/gmtpy). [Tutorial](http://emolch.github.io/gmtpy/tutorial.html)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) :: is a 2D/3D plotting library that can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell (ala MATLAB or Mathematica), web application servers, etc.. to generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc, with just a few lines of code.
