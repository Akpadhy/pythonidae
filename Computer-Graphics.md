# GRAPHICS 
* [EigenFace](https://github.com/bugra/EigenFace) :: EigenFace implementation in Python for Yale FaceDatabase. Eigenvectors are used in the computer vision problem of human face recognition.
* PIL :: [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/), now forked as [pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/) to support Python-3.x


# INFOGRAPHICS
* [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) :: is a Python library for visualizing large and realtime datasets on the web. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of Protovis/D3, while delivering high-performance interactivity to thin clients. Bokeh includes its own Javascript library (BokehJS) that implements a reactive scenegraph representation of the plot, and renders efficiently to HTML5 Canvas. Bokeh works well with IPython Notebook, but can generate standalone graphics that embed into regular HTML. If you are a Matplotlib user, you can just use %bokeh magic to start interacting with your plots in the notebook immediately!
* [d3py](https://github.com/mikedewar/d3py) :: is a plottling library for Python based on the JavaScript library "[D3.js](http://d3js.org/)".
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) :: is a 2D/3D plotting library that can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell (ala MATLAB or Mathematica), web application servers, etc.. to generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc, with just a few lines of code.

   * [mplot3d tutorial](http://matplotlib.org/1.3.1/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/tutorial.html)
* [Pylab](http://wiki.scipy.org/PyLab) :: is Matplotlib's pylab interface for interactive mode.
* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python) :: is an API and webhost for all your Python web plotting needs.
