# ASTRONOMY
* astropy → [Astronomy Python Library](https://github.com/astropy)
* [Celestialbody](https://github.com/jsbj/celestialbody) is a library for calculating the climate and weather on existing and hypothetical planets and moons.
* [EchelleTools](https://github.com/iancze/EchelleTools) are command-line tools to process high resolution echelle spectra from astronomical instruments (TRES, HIRES, Spex, etc...) into a common HDF5 format.
* [LRG_redshifts](https://github.com/jakevdp/LRG_redshifts) ::  Finding double redshifts in SDSS LRGs.
* [ProbabilisticLensing](https://github.com/jakevdp/ProbabilisticLensing) :: A probabilistic formalism of weak lensing, based on Bayes Nets/Probabilistic Graphical Models.
* [ShutterCorrect](https://github.com/iancze/ShutterCorrect) calculates a shutter correction map for digital images. Primarily designed for correcting astronomical images to achieve the desired illumination.


# GIS 
* [Geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy) → is a Geocoding Toolbox for Python 2 and 3 for several popular geocoding web services.
* Karta → [A tidy Python package for geospatial computation](https://github.com/njwilson23/karta)
* MASSACR :: [Modeling Altered Seafloor: Simulation and Climatic Response](https://github.com/navahnavahnavah/massacr)
* pygeoip → [Pure Python API for Maxmind's binary GeoIP databases](https://github.com/appliedsec/pygeoip)
* [Pyshp](https://github.com/GeospatialPython/pyshp) library reads and writes ESRI Shapefiles in pure Python.
