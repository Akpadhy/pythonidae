# ASTRONOMY
* [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy) → [Astronomy Python Library.
* [Celestialbody](https://github.com/jsbj/celestialbody) is a library for calculating the climate and weather on existing and hypothetical planets and moons.
* [EchelleTools](https://github.com/iancze/EchelleTools) are command-line tools to process high resolution echelle spectra from astronomical instruments (TRES, HIRES, Spex, etc...) into a common HDF5 format.
- [Enrico](https://github.com/gammapy/enrico) helps you with your Fermi data analysis. [Documentation](http://enrico.readthedocs.org/)
- [Gammapy](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy) :: A Python package for gamma-ray astronomy. [Documentation](https://gammapy.readthedocs.org/)
- [Gamma-speed](https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-speed) :: Measure gamma-ray data analysis speed (focus on multi-core likelihood fitting speed-ups). [Documentation](https://gamma-speed.readthedocs.org/)
- [LRG_redshifts](https://github.com/jakevdp/LRG_redshifts) ::  Finding double redshifts in SDSS LRGs.
- [ProbabilisticLensing](https://github.com/jakevdp/ProbabilisticLensing) :: A probabilistic formalism of weak lensing, based on Bayes Nets/Probabilistic Graphical Models.
- [ShutterCorrect](https://github.com/iancze/ShutterCorrect) calculates a shutter correction map for digital images. Primarily designed for correcting astronomical images to achieve the desired illumination.


# GIS
