# Blogs
* [Neural Networks, Manifolds, and Topology](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/)

# MOOC
#### Coursera.org   
* [High Performance Scientific Computing](https://www.coursera.org/course/scicomp)

# Machine Learning
* [Machine Learning Video Library](http://work.caltech.edu/library/)

# SOFTWARE
* impyla :: [Python client and Numba-based UDFs for Cloudera Impala](https://github.com/cloudera/impyla). Impala allows you to rapidly analyze large, distributed data sets, but doesn't integrate easily with your ad hoc (Python) analytical tools (pandas, scikit-learn), which impyla aims to remedy.
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) :: adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 
* [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org) :: System for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation, is a mathematical software with features covering many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus.
* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org) :: it contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.
   * _Tutorials_
   * scipy-lectures :: [Tutorial material on the scientific Python ecosystem](http://scipy-lectures.github.io)

# MATH
### Calculus 
* [finitediff](https://github.com/bjodah/finitediff) :: A Fortran-90 version of Begnt Fornberg's formulae for optimized inter-/extrapolation of data series for up to N-th order derivative with C/C++/Python bindings.
