# DISTRIBUTED-PARALLEL
**Libraries for Cloud/Cluster Computing**

+ [clusterlib](https://github.com/clusterlib/clusterlib) :: Tools to manage jobs on supercomputer. [Documentation](http://clusterlib.readthedocs.org/)
+ [Pathos](https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos) :: A framework for parallel graph management and execution in heterogeneous computing. It primarily provides the communication mechanisms for configuring and launching parallel computations across heterogenous resources. Pathos provides configurable launchers for parallel and distributed computing, where each launcher contains the syntactic logic to configure and launch jobs in an execution environment.
+ [Pyina](https://github.com/uqfoundation/pyina) :: a MPI-based parallel mapper and launcher.


## AWS
- [AmazonEC2scripts](https://github.com/swederik/AmazonEC2scripts) :: Useful scripts to setup Amazon EC2 Cloud Compute servers for Neuroimaging.
- [Anaconda-ec2](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-ec2) :: Anaconda plugin for StarCluster.
- [Cloudman](https://bitbucket.org/chapmanb/cloudman) :: Easily create a compute cluster on top of a cloud computing infrastructure.
- [kappa](https://github.com/garnaat/kappa) :: Kappa is a command line tool that makes it easier to deploy, update, and test functions for AWS Lambda.
- [StarCluster](http://star.mit.edu/cluster) is an open source cluster-computing toolkit for Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). [Source code on Github](https://github.com/jtriley/StarCluster)


## APACHE 
- [SparklingPandas](https://github.com/holdenk/sparklingpandas) aims to make it easy to use the distributed computing power of Py[Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) to scale your data anlysis with Pandas.

#### Hadoop
* [Hue](https://github.com/cloudera/hue) ::  is a Web application for interacting with Apache Hadoop. It supports a file and job browser, Hive, Pig, Impala, Spark, Oozie, HBase, Solr, Sqoop2, ZooKeeper and more.


## HPC
* [Pyston](https://github.com/dropbox/pyston) â†’ is an open-source Python implementation using JIT techniques, built using LLVM for performance speed. Their blog [introducing Pyston](https://tech.dropbox.com/2014/04/introducing-pyston-an-upcoming-jit-based-python-implementation/)
* [PySGE](https://github.com/jiahao/PySGE) :: Low-level Python interface to Sun Grid Engine.
