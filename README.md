Inspired by the **Julia.jl** repo, I decided to create an exclusive repo listing Python packages, cookbooks, etc.. for data science programmers using Python. There are tons of resources for Python programmers but its scattered across the web, so [DataScience-PY](http://svaksha.github.io/DataScience-PY) is my attempt to curate decibans of resources exclusively for data scientists using Python as their programming language. 

This repo is mirrored at:
* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/svaksha/DataScience-PY) :: git clone git@bitbucket.org:svaksha/DataScience-PY.git
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/svaksha/DataScience-PY) :: git clone git@gitlab.com:svaksha/DataScience-PY.git 

### Install
* To start programming with Python you need to [setup your local Python environment](http://www.datarobot.com/blog/getting-up-and-running-with-python), then work your way through this workshop material for "[Introduction to Data Processing with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/)".

### Contributing
Some tips for submitting a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/svaksha/DataScience-PY/pulls):
* Add your link as per the topic, with notes (if any) to the respective MarkDown (.md) pages in the repo.
* For broken links submit a bug report, or replace the broken URI, then submit a PR.
* For Documentation and cookbooks, check if it matches the categories listed, if yes, then list it against *DOC*, else use the [Cookbook.md](https://github.com/svaksha/DataScience-PY/blob/master/Cookbook.md) page.
