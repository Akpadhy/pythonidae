### Quant
- [kcbo](https://github.com/HHammond/kcbo) :: A Bayesian testing framework written in Python. 
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) :: is flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures similar to R data.frame objects, statistical functions, and much more. [Source code](https://github.com/pydata/pandas)
   * __Resources__
