# Jupyter
- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org), 'nee [IPython](http://ipython.org/), provides a rich architecture for interactive computing with interactive shells (terminal and Qt-based) and browser-based notebook support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits.
- [Colaboratory](https://github.com/jupyter/colaboratory) :: Create and store notebooks in Google Drive and allow for collaborative editing of notebooks.
- [Ipython_memory_usage](https://github.com/ianozsvald/ipython_memory_usage) tool reports memory usage deltas for every command you type
- [IPythonblocks](http://ipythonblocks.org) :: Practice Python with colored grids in the IPython Notebook. [Source code](https://github.com/jiffyclub/ipythonblocks)
- [ipython-sql](https://github.com/catherinedevlin/ipython-sql) :: Introduces a %sql (or %%sql) magic for Jupyter/IPython. Connect to a database, using SQLAlchemy connect strings, then issue SQL commands within IPython or IPython Notebook.
- [Multiuser-server](https://github.com/jupyter/multiuser-server) :: Multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks.
- [NBDiff](http://nbdiff.org) :: A diffing and merging tool for the IPython Notebook.

# Web
- [Spyre](https://github.com/adamhajari/spyre) : A Web Application Framework for providing a simple user interface for Python data projects and data visualization, so you'll also need pandas and matplotlib in addition to cherrypy, with jinja2 templating.
