# IPython
- [IPython](http://ipython.org/) provides a rich architecture for interactive computing with interactive shells (terminal and Qt-based) and browser-based notebook support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits.
- [Ipython_memory_usage](https://github.com/ianozsvald/ipython_memory_usage) tool reports memory usage deltas for every command you type
- [IPythonblocks](http://ipythonblocks.org) :: Practice Python with colored grids in the IPython Notebook. [Source code](https://github.com/jiffyclub/ipythonblocks)
- [NBDiff](http://nbdiff.org) :: A diffing and merging tool for the IPython Notebook.

### Jupyter
- [Colaboratory](https://github.com/jupyter/colaboratory) :: Create and store notebooks in Google Drive and allow for collaborative editing of notebooks.
- [Multiuser-server](https://github.com/jupyter/multiuser-server) :: Multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks.
