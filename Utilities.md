# 2to3
__Python 2&3 tools__
+ [python-future](http://python-future.org) :: Easy, clean, reliable Python 2/3 compatibility. [Source code](https://github.com/PythonCharmers/python-future) and a [cheat sheet for writing Python 2-3 compatible code](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html). 

----

# DOCUMENTATION
**Documentation tools**
+ [PythonTeX](https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex) :: A LaTeX package that provides fast, user-friendly access to Python code entered within a TeX document to be executed, and the output to be included in the original document. It also provides syntax highlighting for code within LaTeX documents via the Pygments syntax highlighter. PythonTeX also provides support for Ruby, Julia, and Octave programming languages.
+ [Scisphinx](https://github.com/numfocus/scisphinx) :: Sphinx extensions common to the scientific computing ecosystem.

----

# General Utilities 
**Desktop User Interface, GUI, IDE's, etc..**

## Desktop Document processing 
+ [Pweave](https://github.com/mpastell/Pweave) :: A scientific report generator and a literate programming tool for Python. Pweave can capture the results and plots from data analysis and works well with numpy, scipy and matplotlib. Pweave is inspired by Sweave, an excellent tool for R programmers, and the syntax is mostly compatible with it.

## Jupyter-IPython
+ [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org), 'nee [IPython](http://ipython.org/), provides a rich architecture for interactive computing with interactive shells (terminal and Qt-based) and browser-based notebook support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits.
+ [Colaboratory](https://github.com/jupyter/colaboratory) :: Create and store notebooks in Google Drive and allow for collaborative editing of notebooks.
