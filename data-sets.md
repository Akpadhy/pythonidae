# Genome
+ A database of OA/free [RNA-seq and genomic](http://jtleek.com/data/) data-sets used in research projects at JHU.
+ Download [Gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) data (via ftp) which integrates information from a wide range of species. A record may include nomenclature, Reference Sequences (RefSeqs), maps, pathways, variations, phenotypes, and links to genome-, phenotype-, and locus-specific resources worldwide.

+ NCBI's [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)
+ [DataLad](http://datalad.org) :: aims to provide access to scientific data available from various sources (e.g. lab or consortium web-sites such as Human connectome; data sharing portals such as OpenFMRI and CRCNS) through a single convenient interface and integrated with your software package managers (such as APT in Debian). Although initially targeting neuroimaging and neuroscience data in general, it will not be limited by the domain and a wide range of contributions are welcome.
